Data visualization challenges

This repository will be updated periodically with new data visualization challenges. 

2/16/19. The first challenge: let's learn something about doctoral degree holders!
Step 1: Check out the available data on https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data
Step 2: I downloaded & did some very minimal data cleaning on Table 13. 
  Check out the boring scatterplot I made of Epidemiology doctorates over time.
  Can you make it better? 
  Can you automate the data cleaning? 
Step 3: Find something interesting about doctoral degrees in the other data!
